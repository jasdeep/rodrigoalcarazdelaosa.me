[Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/) has revealed the first trailer for the new **Assassin's Creed Valhalla**, to be released on 17 November 2020[^1].

[^1]: [Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/) has also released a gameplay overview:

## Build Your Own Viking Legend
> Become Eivor, a Viking raider raised to be a fearless warrior, and lead your clan from icy desolation in Norway to a new home amid the lush farmlands of ninth-century England. Find your settlement and conquer this hostile land by any means to earn a place in Valhalla.
England in the age of the Vikings is a fractured nation of petty lords and warring kingdoms. Beneath the chaos lies a rich and untamed land waiting for a new conqueror. Will it be you?

This little summary reminds $\infty$ to the series **Vikings** (you can find it in [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/70301870)), which I strongly recommend you to see if you haven't done it.

## Features
### Write Your Viking Saga
![viking saga](https://staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/11fnAIXY73SvPgCwsFJTGf/8b6e9f81d7a4544339c9ec8a1d64f14c/ACK_WriteYourVikingSaga__1_.png)

> Blaze your own path across England with advanced RPG mechanics. Fight brutal battles, lead fiery raids or use strategy and alliances with other leaders to bring victory. Every choice you make in combat and conversation is another step on the path to greatness.

It seems that they continue with the path started by [**Odyssey**](https://assassinscreed.ubisoft.com/game/en-gb/odyssey) regarding the use of **RPG mechanics**.

### Lead Epic Raids

> Lead a crew of raiders and launch lightning-fast surprise attacks against Saxon armies and fortresses. Claim the riches of your enemies' lands for your clan and expand your influence far beyond your growing settlement.

You couldn't miss the **raids** on a **Viking** adventure, could you?

### Engage in Visceral Combat
![visceral combat](https://staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/5JE9v6dbyUyWc6cVkw8MXR/dc377befabf3505ee1caec6cb9f70f30/ac-full-width_combat_desktop.png)

> Unleash the ruthless fighting style of a Viking warrior as you dual-wield axes, swords, or even shields against relentless foes. Decapitate opponents in close-quarters combat, riddle them with arrows, or assassinate them with your Hidden Blade.

Hopefully we will see combat elements taken from [**For Honor**](https://forhonor.ubisoft.com/game/en-gb/home/).

### Grow Your Settlement

> Your clan's new home grows with your legend. Customise your settlement by building upgradable structures. Unlock new features and quests by constructing a barracks, a blacksmith, a tattoo parlour, and much more.

This is something we Assassin's Creed fans have always liked and missed in the last few releases. Great!

### Share Your Custom Raider

> Recruit mercenary Vikings designed by other players or create and customise your own to share online. Sit back and reap the rewards when they fight alongside your friends in their game worlds.

A good way to **involve the community**, something they've already done very well in [Origins](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed-origins/) and [Odyssey](https://assassinscreed.ubisoft.com/game/en-gb/odyssey).

## A Dark Age Open World

> Sail across the icy North Sea to discover and conquer the broken kingdoms of England. Immerse yourself in activities like hunting and drinking games or engage in traditional Norse competitions like flyting â€“ or, as it's better known, verbally devastating rivals through the art of the Viking rap battle.

I have no doubt that [Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/) will have created a world full of life, taking care of every detail, in the style of what we have been used to since [Black Flag](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed-4-black-flag/).
