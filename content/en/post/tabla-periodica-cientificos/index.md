Inspired by the [DC Periodic Table]({{< ref "/post/tabla-periodica-DC/index.md" >}}), here I present my version with **distinguished scientists**.

By clicking on the button above you can download a **PDF** where each image is a **link** that takes you to the scientist's Wikipedia page. In addition, on the back (second page of the PDF) you can see both the **name** of each **element** and that of each **scientist** (both linked to Wikipedia).

## Notes
Some **notes** on the Table:

- As far as possible, we have chosen scientists (physicists/chemists and some mathematicians) whose surname reminds us of the element's name (both pronounced in English).
- Elements named after a scientist are associated with that scientist.
- Elements whose symbol coincides with a unit that comes from a scientist have been associated with that scientist.
- When in doubt, the priority has been to choose the most important scientists and/or Nobel Prize winners.
